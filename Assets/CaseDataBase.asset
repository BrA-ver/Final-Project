    npcDescription: 'Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers
      to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has
      no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
      forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing
      challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story
      and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere
      in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph
      be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges
      is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph
      into their writing. '

    npcDescription: 'A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer
      to tackle writers'' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck
      with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting
      a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of
      the issues that may have been causing the writers'' block in the first place. '

    npcDescription: 'Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
      routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try
      to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is
      to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day''s
      writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers. '
